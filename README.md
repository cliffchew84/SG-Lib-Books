# Web App - Books Available in SG Libraries (NLB)

This is the repository for a side project, [SGLibReads](https://sg-nlb-available-books.onrender.com/), which is a free web app for Singapore residents to search, save and more easily view the availability of Singapore library books. If you are a heavy user of the Singapore libraries, consider giving this web app a try.

## Tell Me Why?

### Why One - Providing a better way to search for NLB books

As of 2023, both the Singapore National Library Boardâ€™s (NLB) app and website are great and functional. However, I found it difficult to save and search for book availability on their app and website. Wanting an easier way to hunt down the library books, I hacked out a rudimentary technical solution for my own personal use. As the stars started to align and I learned more technical skills, thanks to NLB and the NLB Udemy Biz account no less, I realised I could develop a solution for the general Singapore public too. I hope to create value for the Singapore public, using skills I learned from public funds.

### Why Two - Changing SG government tech culture

When I learned about the [NLB public APIs](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/partner-us/contribute-and-create-with-us/NLBLabs), I realise I could use it for this side project. Unfortunately, the NLB API has so far provided a rather subpar developer experience (see my review [here](https://medium.com/@cliffy-gardens/how-good-is-our-latest-singapore-library-apis-an-honest-review-c32b03e8299b)). Nonetheless, I do feel this is also a chance to start more conversations on how some of our government agencies are running their tech deployments. I know there are competent government agencies running excellent tech solutions for Singapore too, and I hope this side project can do its part to contribute to the further strengthening of the Singapore technical core. Those interested in this conversation can follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@cliffy-gardens), or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cliff-chew-kt/).

### Why Three - Adding more technical skills

This side project is also a way for me to continue to learn and apply more technical skills into a reasonably real-world setting. Some of the possible features I hope to learn and include into this web app includes:

1. Availability of eBooks
2. Linking to NLB Events from EventBrite
3. Recommending books
