# Web App - Books Available in SG Libraries (NLB)

This is the repository for a side project, [SGLibReads](https://sg-nlb-available-books.onrender.com/), which is a free web app for Singapore residents to search, save and more easily view the availability of Singapore library books. If you are a heavy user of the Singapore libraries, consider giving this web app a try.

## Tell Me Why?

### Why One - Providing a better way to search for NLB books

As of 2023, both the Singapore National Library Boardâ€™s (NLB) app and website are great and functional. However, I found it difficult to save and search for book availability on their app and website. Wanting an easier way to hunt down the library books, I hacked out a rudimentary technical solution for my own personal use. As the stars started to align and I learned more technical skills, thanks to NLB and the NLB Udemy Biz account no less, I realised I could develop a solution for the general Singapore public too. I hope to create value for the Singapore public, using skills I learned from public funds.

### Why Two - Changing SG government tech culture

When I learned about the [NLB public APIs](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/partner-us/contribute-and-create-with-us/NLBLabs), I realise I could use it for this side project. Unfortunately, the NLB API has so far provided a rather subpar developer experience (see my review [here](https://medium.com/@cliffy-gardens/how-good-is-our-latest-singapore-library-apis-an-honest-review-c32b03e8299b)). Nonetheless, I do feel this is also a chance to start more conversations on how some of our government agencies are running their tech deployments. I know there are competent government agencies running excellent tech solutions for Singapore too, and I hope this side project can do its part to contribute to the further strengthening of the Singapore technical core. Those interested in this conversation can follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@cliffy-gardens), or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cliff-chew-kt/).

### Why Three - Adding more technical skills

This side project is also a way for me to continue to learn and apply more technical skills into a reasonably real-world setting. Some of the possible features I hope to learn and include into this web app includes:

1. Availability of eBooks
2. Linking to NLB Events from EventBrite
3. Recommending books

## Getting Started

The following section details the setup steps and development workflow for this web-app.

### Prerequisites

Development:

    - Node.js and npm (for frontend)
    - Python (for backend)
    - Supabase CLI
    - Docker (for Supabase)

Deployment:

    - Firebase CLI
    - Google Cloud CLI

### 1.0 Setup Steps

#### 1.1 Supabase Setup

The [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/cli) is required to manage
 the database schema and seed data. Please follow the instructions below:

1. Install Supabase CLI using the official guide [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#installing-the-supabase-cli).

1. Authenticate Supabase CLI with the following command:

    ```bash
    supabase login
    ```

1. Start the local Supabase instance:.

    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```

1. As the local Supabase instance spinned up, take note of the `anon key`
 and `service_role key` from the console as they need to be filled into
 `.env` files of front-end and back-end subsequently.

#### 1.2 Back-end FastAPI Server Setup

1. Navigate to back-end directory:

    ```bash
    cd back-end
    ```

1. Install `uv` in your local machine. Please follow the
 [official guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
 for more information.

1. Copy the example environment file:.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. Update the .env file with the Supabase API keys and other necessary configurations.
 Do note that you need to request for a API Key to access NLB's Catalogue API [here](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/partner-us/contribute-and-create-with-us/NLBLabs).

#### 1.3 Front-end Svelte Setup

1. Navigate to front-end directory:

    ```bash
    cd front-end
    ```

1. Copy the example environment file. Remember to update your Supabase anon key accordingly.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. Install dependencies with npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 2.0 Development Workflow

1. Start-up Supabase server with supabase-cli.

    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```

1. Run Backend (FastAPI)

    ```bash
    cd back-end
    uv run -- uvicorn src.main:app --reload
    ```

1. Run Frontend (Svelte)

    ```bash
    cd front-end
    npm run dev -- --open
    ```

### 3.0 Building and Deploying for Production

1. Backend Deployment to Google Artifact Registry

    - Automated CI/CD pipeline triggers on push to main branch
    - Builds Docker image
    - Pushes to Google Artifact Registry
    - Deploys to specified Google Cloud Run for managed container service.

2. Frontend Deployment to Firebase Hosting

    - Automated CI/CD pipeline triggers on push to main branch
    - Builds Svelte application
    - Deploys to Firebase Hosting

### Code Linting and Formating

This project uses [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) as Python
code linter and formatter while [prettier](https://prettier.io) is used
for Typescript.

To integrate this seamlessly to your development workflow, we recommend
using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run the formatter and linter before
commiting to the repo.

1. run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts

    ```bash
    $ pre-commit install
    pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
    ```

2. run `git commit` as usual to commit your changes.
